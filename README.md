# AirQualityMonitor-NaanMudhalvan


Procedure to Develop the project for Air Quality using PM2.5 sensor and ESP8266 along with Arduino are given below:

1. To connect the test the Arduino (also includes installing Arduino IDE) using Arduino Power cable.
2. Code from *PM_with_Arduino.ino* must be uploaded in Arduino IDE for interfacing with PM 2.5 sensor.
3. Connection must be established between ThingSpeak(also includescreating an account and channel in ThingSpeak) and ESP8266 module.
4. Code from *ESP_with_Thinkspeak.ino* must be uploaded in Arduino IDE for establishing connection between ThingSpeak and Arduino.
5. Network name and password must be changed according to the user's network.
6. UI can be created using *Index.html*(Channel ID and API must also be included) 
7. Data retrieval takes place within the application.
8. Project can be executed by running the *Index.html*.
